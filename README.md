# product-cards

## Description
This project is an exercise in HTML, CSS, and Flexbox layouts.  JavaScript was not required, but in order to add a randomizing feature, a few lines of code were incorporated.  Six mock product cards are laid out in two rows, each with separate sections featuring a product title, image, and information about the product.  Various text stylings, colors, and text-alignments are used in order to follow certain formatting criteria.  The user is also able to click a button at the top, which will randomly decide which products are sold out and overlay a special image over the sold out products.
